The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
The input containing an integer ‘n’ which denotes the given number. Print the numbers in the sequence as output.

Test Cases:
Case 1:
Input
5

Output
5 16 8 4 2 1

Case 2:
Input
1

Output
1 

Case 3:
Input
4

Output
4 2 1
